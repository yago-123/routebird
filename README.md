# Routebird

## Description
`routebird` is a Kubernetes-native **BGP controller** that dynamically announces service IPs using a CRD to configure BGP
peers, local ASNs, and service selectors.

Integrate Kubernetes with your existing network infrastructure to simplify IP management and enable advanced routing
scenarios like load balancing and high availabilityâ€”without relying solely on external load balancers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go version v1.23.0+
